I am a senior Computer Science major with an emphasis in mobile apps.

I am from Curacao which is a small island in the Caribbean. I graduated Indian Hills CC with a degree in computer software development with an emphasis on web development. After graduation I worked for 7 month as a web developer before returning to school to get my BA. Some technologies I used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, AngularJS, PHP and some other web development tools.

After graduation I plan on working doing mobile apps development and some web development in a more relaxed fun working environment such as they have at a company called Shift Interactive.

Something most people in the US think is interesting about me is that I can speak 4 languages although it is normal where I am from. Those languages are Papiamentu (native), Dutch, Spanish and English.
